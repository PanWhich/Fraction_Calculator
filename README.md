# Fraction_Calculator
made a fraction calculator using C++.

Fraction calculator has some bugs left in it. I plan to fix the bugs and allow the user to input the actual fractions

By pressing the cordinated keys the program will add, subtract, divide, and multiply any fraction. 

If you do not enter a fraction it will automatically restore it to zero.

afer you are done with the program you can simply leave with the exit key
